# Component Structure Guide

The [components/](mdc:components) directory contains all React components used throughout the project.

- Shared UI elements and reusable primitives are located in [components/ui/](mdc:components/ui).
- Feature-specific components are organized in their own subfolders within [components/](mdc:components), following the feature or domain they support.

When creating new components, place shared or generic UI elements in the `ui` subfolder, and feature-specific components in a relevant subfolder or at the root of `components/` if not part of a larger feature set.

This structure helps maintain separation of concerns and promotes reusability across the codebase.
